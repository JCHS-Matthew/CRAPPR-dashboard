# CRAPPR dashboard
 Simple dashboard for office ping pong ratings (CRAPPR). Created for fun and to try out Bootstrap, which seems fine.
 
Ratings are computed using a modified implementation of the Microsoft TrueSkill algorithm, following the C# implementation by @moserware (https://github.com/moserware/Skills). All the other repos that reference TrueSkill have a line in their readme saying that TrueSkill is a Microsoft copyright and you can't use if for commercial purposes, so I'll say that too and just assume 1) that it's true, and 2) that it's a reasonable CYA.
